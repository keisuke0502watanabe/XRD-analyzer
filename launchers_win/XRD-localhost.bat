REM  XRD Analyzer - open on http://localhost  (Windows)
REM
REM  Run: double-click this file, or run it from a terminal:
REM       XRD-localhost.bat
REM
REM  Keep this file in the "launchers_win" folder inside the XRD-analyzer
REM  repo, so that "cd .." lands on the repo root where the HTML lives.
REM
REM  Why http://localhost instead of file:// : a real origin lets the
REM  browser keep your IndexedDB data (DB / projects) far more reliably.
REM  Requires Python 3 (from python.org or the Microsoft Store).
